## GUITAR PROJECT ##
The initial objective is to create some supports documents that can help to learn the basics of guitar chords. To pursue this goal, one master XCF document was created and filled with a whole existed content that has been manually created. Which means that the process is not automated and that the presentation is not well whole formatted and (may) need somme improvments, manual or automated ones.

# CHORDS CLASSIFICATION #
The chords are sorted by 4 majors categories which are : 
  - MAJOR CHORDS
  - MINOR CHORDS
  - SUSPENDED CHORDS
  - INVERTED CHORDS
  
 Each category is subdivised in many variants that mostly correspond to reiterables patterns.
 
 # CURRENTS LIMITATIONS #
  - no automation in anyway although some scripts have already been developped
  - bad formmatting that can be improved
  - diagrams limited to A scale (because no automation)
  
  # SEE FORWARD #
    - include ukulele, banjo, mandolin, cavaquinho, and other chords instruments in their basic tuning
    - include piano
